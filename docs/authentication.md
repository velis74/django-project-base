# Authentication

## Obtaining and maintaining sessions

We support two methods of maintaining session information for your client: cookie-based and header-based.

When you perform the account/login function, you can choose whether the function should return a session cookie or JSON
with session id. Add parameter "return-type" with value "json" to login function parameters. This will return
"sessionid" parameter in returned json instead of cookie. There is no CSRF when session is passed by the authorization
header. See swagger documentation on login for further details.

If you choose the cookie, you will then need to supply the cookie(s) to all subsequent requests. Likewise, if you opt
for session id as a variable, you will have to provide Authorization header to all subsequent requests.

The default uses cookies as those also add a CSRF cookie providing a bit more security. Use of JSON / header should only
be preferred for clients without support for cookies, such as background maintenance / data exchange scripts.

Our modified SessionMiddleware only overrides Django's as much to also accept the Authorization header and clears the
session and CSRF cookies in the responses.

## Activate project base accounts API endpoints

```python
urlpatterns = [
        path('account/', include('django_project_base.account.urls')),
        # ...
]
```

### Session middleware

To enable project base SessionMiddleware, replace Django contrib SessionMiddleware with project base SessionMiddleware
in projects settings.py file. This is only necessary if you intend to support the JSON method for login and keeping the
session id.

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
        # ...
        'django_project_base.account.SessionMiddleware',
        # ...
]
```

## Use of json session id in subsequent requests

When using the Authorisation header, use returned session api as token with token type "sessionid" and returned
sessionid as credentials.

```python

Authorization: sessionid < credentials >
```

## User caching backend

To increase AUTH performance you can set a backend that caches users.

To enable User caching backend replace django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend with the following line to
*AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS* section in settings.py:

```python

# myproject/settings.py

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        ...
        'django_project_base.base.auth_backends.UsersCachingBackend',
        ...
)
```

User caching does not work on bulk updates as Django doesn't trigger signals on update(), bulk_update() or delete().
Bulk updating user profiles without manually clearing cache for them will create stale cache entries, so make sure you
clear any such cache entries manually using the provided :code:`user_cache_invalidate` function.

Example for clearing cache after bulk update:

```python

...
from django.core.cache import cache
from django_project_base.base.auth_backends import user_cache_invalidate

...
# Bulk update multiple users. Give them superuser permission.
# If those users are logged in, they don't have permission until cache is
# cleared or they log out and log in again.
UserProfile.objects.filter(username__in=['miha', 'janez'])
    .update(is_superuser=True, is_staff=True)

# After clearing users cache for those users will be able
# to work with additional permissions
staff = UserProfile.objects.filter(username__in=['miha', 'janez'])
for user in staff:
    user_cache_invalidate(user)
```

It is possible to add a clear cache option also for bulk updates if needed with a custom QuerySet manager. Example code
below.

```python

# models.py
...
from django.core.cache import cache
from django_project_base.base.auth_backends import user_cache_invalidate

...


class ProfilesQuerySet(models.QuerySet):
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        for profile in self:
            user_cache_invalidate(profile)
        res = super(ProfilesQuerySet, self).update(**kwargs)
        return res

    def delete(self):
        for profile in self:
            user_cache_invalidate(profile)
        res = super(ProfilesQuerySet, self).delete()
        return res


class UserProfile(BaseProfile):
    """Use this only for enabling cache clear for bulk update"""
    objects = ProfilesQuerySet.as_manager()


...
```

## Social auth integrations

Django Project Base offers easy-to-setup social authentication mechanism. Currently the following providers are
supported:

- Facebook
    - provider identifier: facebook
- Google
    - provider identifier: google-oauth2
- Twitter
    - provider identifier: twitter
- Microsoft
    - provider identifier: microsoft-graph
- Github
    - provider identifier: github
- Gitlab
    - provider identifier: gitlab

OAuth providers require redirect URL which is called after the authentication process in Oauth flow.

Your redirect url is: [SCHEME]://[HOST]/account/social/complete/[PROVIDER IDENTIFIER]/

Information which settings are required for a social provider can be found
at https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/index.html

For social authentication functionalities `Python Social Auth <https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io>`_ library was
used. Please checkout this documentation to make any custom changes.

### Installation

Add app to your installed apps.

```python

# myproject/settings.py

from django_project_base.accounts import ACCOUNT_APP_ID

INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'social_django',
        ACCOUNT_APP_ID,
        ...
]
```

Make sure you have django project base urls included:

```python

# url.py

urlpatterns = [
        .....
            path('account/', include(accounts_router.urls)),
        path('account/social/', include('social_django.urls', namespace="social")),
        .....
]
```

Run migrations:

```bash
$ python manage.py migrate
```

### Social login integration example - Google

To enable a social provider create an account at provider webpage and create an oauth app. For example for Google OAuth
login visit https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials. Click + CREATE CREDENTIALS and select Oauth Client
ID. Then create OAuth app with OAuth Consent screen.

Example value for Authorized JavaScript origins can be http://localhost:8080.

Example value for Authorized redirect URIs can be http://localhost:8080/account/social/complete/google-oauth2/.

To enable Google OAuth login add folowing to settings:

```python
    # myproject/settings.py
# enable google social login
SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY = '*Client ID*'
SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET = '*Client secret*'
```
